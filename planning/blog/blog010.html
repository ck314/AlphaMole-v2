<h1>Summary of Today's Work: App Fixes and Styling Enhancements</h1>
<div class="date">June 12, 2025</div>
<p>Today was a productive day focused on resolving critical issues and enhancing the visual consistency of the AlphaMole web application. Our primary efforts centered around getting the React app to run smoothly and ensuring a uniform look across various blog and checklist entries.</p>

<h2>Key Achievements Today:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Resolved React App Startup Issues:</strong> We addressed dependency conflicts and parsing errors that prevented the React application from running correctly. This involved updating package versions and moving static HTML content into the `public` directory, allowing Vite to serve these files without attempting to process them as React components.</li>
    <li><strong>Eliminated Unintended Centering:</strong> We identified and removed global and component-specific CSS rules that were causing content to be unintentionally centered on various pages, including the checklist post pages. This ensures that content layout is now controlled more precisely by the React components.</li>
    <li><strong>Standardized Blog Post Styling:</strong> We refactored the HTML content of blog posts 003, 004, and 006. This involved removing outdated HTML boilerplate and ensuring that only the essential blog content (title, date, paragraphs, lists) is provided to the React component for rendering. This consistency now ensures all blog posts adapt to the application's modern styling.</li>
    <li><strong>Refined Blog Post 001 Date Placement:</strong> We adjusted the date display for blog post 001, removing a redundant date and repositioning the main date to appear directly below the title for improved readability and consistency with other posts.</li>
</ul>

<p>These crucial updates significantly improve the application's stability, maintainability, and user experience. We're now in a much better position to continue building out new features for AlphaMole.</p>
