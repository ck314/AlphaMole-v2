        <h1>AlphaMole Finds a New Home</h1>
        
        <p>Today, I configured GitHub and set up a custom domain to move AlphaMole to its new home at www.alphamole.ca. It involved a lot of tedious steps â€” I gave up on it a couple of times, but eventually returned and got it done.</p>

        <p>I also made some changes to the blog system to make it easier to add new entries going forward. Overall, today was a cleanup and organization day.</p>

        <p>I'm looking forward to diving into the chemistry work and neural networks soon.</p>
