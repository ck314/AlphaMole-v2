        <h1>Standardization and Color: AlphaMole's Structure Reborn</h1>
		<p>Note that this blog entry includes work done on two days, May 18 and today. Today's work somehow deleted all the work from Sunday so I had to redo it all.</p>
        <p>Today marked a major organizational update for AlphaMole. After a previous accidental deletion, I recreated the standardized folder structure, ensuring that all assets are now neatly organized into <b>CSS</b>, <b>JS</b>, and <b>Data</b> directories. This not only makes the project easier to navigate, but also sets a strong foundation for future development.</p>
        <div class="project-title">Re-adding the Elements</div>
        <p>The <code>elements.json</code> file was re-added, now containing structured atomic information and color coding for each element. This enables dynamic color assignment throughout the application, making the interface more visually informative and engaging.</p>
        <div class="project-title">A More Colorful Main Page</div>
        <p>The main page's color scheme was updated to reflect the unique color of each atomic element, providing instant visual feedback and a more immersive experience. Additionally, the main page now features two distinct boxes: <b>AlphaMain</b> and <b>AlphaTest</b>, each serving as a clear entry point for different functionalities.</p>
        <p>With these changes, AlphaMole is more organized, visually appealing, and ready for the next phase of development!</p>
