      <p>Today I started to build Alpha Mole, a neural network project grounded in an exploration of Chemistry.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">ðŸ§ª The Project: An Incremental Molecular Stability Predictor</h2>

      <p>The project aims to bridge concepts from Chemistry (molecular formulas, stability), Computer Science (algorithms, data structures), and Neural Networks (classification, pattern recognition) by training models to predict whether a given set of atoms could potentially form a stable molecule.</p>

      <p>My first step was installing Cursor.</p>

      <p>For now, we took step 1 to load in the periodic table of elements and connect any 2-4 random elements, and then randomly give a checkmark or an X. We haven't built the actual Neural Network yet. We're only at the starting gate.</p>
