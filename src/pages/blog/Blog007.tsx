        <div className="blog-date text-gray-500 mb-6">May 29, 2025</div>

        <p>When you're first learning about neural networks, the inner workings of layers and neurons can feel like a black box of math magic. But as you dig deeper, patterns start to emerge‚Äîlike the role different neurons play within the architecture.</p>

        <p>One interesting insight I came across recently: <strong>not all neurons are meant to be used at the end of a neural network</strong>. Some are specifically designed for use <strong>within hidden layers</strong>‚Äînot as output neurons. This includes some of the most common activation functions:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)</li>
          <li>Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)</li>
          <li>Sigmoid</li>
        </ul>

        <p>But why is that the case?</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">üîç Understanding the Role of Neurons</h2>

        <p>Each neuron in a neural network processes input and passes it along to the next layer. Most neurons apply a <strong>nonlinear activation function</strong>, which introduces complexity and allows the network to learn intricate patterns.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Hidden Layer Neurons:</h3>
        <p>Functions like <code className="bg-gray-100 px-1 rounded">ReLU</code>, <code className="bg-gray-100 px-1 rounded">Tanh</code>, and <code className="bg-gray-100 px-1 rounded">Sigmoid</code> are typically used in <strong>hidden layers</strong> to help the network model complex relationships. They're great for transforming signals in the middle of your model‚Äîbut they <strong>don't inherently know anything about the task you're solving</strong>.</p>

        <p>That's because these activations:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Don't produce outputs that directly correspond to class labels or specific values</li>
          <li>Don't normalize probabilities or constrain output ranges in task-specific ways</li>
          <li><strong>Have no trainable parameters</strong>, so they can't adapt their behavior based on the problem</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">üö´ Why Not Use ReLU or Tanh at the End?</h2>

        <p>Imagine you're building a network for <strong>classification</strong>‚Äîsay, determining if an image is a cat or a dog. Your final output layer needs to make a prediction. If you used <code className="bg-gray-100 px-1 rounded">ReLU</code> at the end, your output could be any positive number, and you'd have <strong>no way to interpret it as a probability</strong>.</p>

        <p>Instead, you'd use a function like <code className="bg-gray-100 px-1 rounded">Softmax</code>, which converts the output into a probability distribution (values between 0 and 1 that add up to 1). For <strong>regression</strong>, you might use a linear output or something like <code className="bg-gray-100 px-1 rounded">sigmoid</code> if you're predicting probabilities.</p>

        <p>So while ReLU is fantastic in the middle of your network for keeping gradients alive and making training efficient, it's not equipped to <strong>output interpretable results</strong> on its own.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">‚úÖ What Should You Use at the End?</h2>

        <p>Depending on the task:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Classification</strong> ‚Üí Use <code className="bg-gray-100 px-1 rounded">Softmax</code> (for multiclass) or <code className="bg-gray-100 px-1 rounded">Sigmoid</code> (for binary)</li>
          <li><strong>Regression</strong> ‚Üí Use <code className="bg-gray-100 px-1 rounded">Linear</code> (no activation)</li>
          <li><strong>Probability outputs</strong> ‚Üí Use <code className="bg-gray-100 px-1 rounded">Sigmoid</code> to constrain between 0 and 1</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These functions are specifically chosen because their <strong>outputs match the format of the task's labels</strong>, and they enable loss functions like cross-entropy or mean squared error to work correctly.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">üß† TL;DR</h2>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>ReLU, Tanh, and Sigmoid are great <strong>activation functions for hidden layers</strong>.</li>
          <li>They <strong>don't have trainable parameters</strong>, so they're used for transformation‚Äînot decision-making.</li>
          <li>The <strong>final layer</strong> of a neural network needs a task-specific function like <code className="bg-gray-100 px-1 rounded">Softmax</code> or <code className="bg-gray-100 px-1 rounded">Linear</code> to produce usable outputs.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Understanding the purpose of different neurons helps demystify how neural networks actually work‚Äîand makes it easier to design better models from the ground up.</p>
