      <div className="blog-date text-gray-500 mb-6">June 19, 2025</div>

      <p>Today marks a major milestone: <strong>AlphaMole v2 has officially launched!</strong> 🎉</p>

      <p>We began by integrating <span className="font-semibold">all the React pages from ChemStability AI</span>—a parallel project and duplicate of AlphaMole that we developed separately. This careful merging process brought together the best features and improvements from both platforms. 🔗</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">🔄 Merging Two Worlds</h2>
      <p>By merging and integrating all the changes from ChemStability into AlphaMole, we unified our codebase and eliminated fragmentation. This not only streamlines development but also ensures that every new feature and fix benefits the entire platform. 🛠️</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">🌱 A Platform for the Future</h2>
      <p>With AlphaMole v2, we now have a robust foundation for future growth. The new platform is ready for rapid iteration, new features, and deeper exploration into molecular AI. This launch sets the stage for the next phase of our journey. ✨</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">📝 TL;DR</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
